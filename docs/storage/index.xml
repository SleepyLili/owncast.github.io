If you&amp;rsquo;re brand new to object storage and not using AWS already I&amp;rsquo;m not sure I&amp;rsquo;d recommend jumping into it just for Owncast. There are other options.
Here&amp;rsquo;s some example usage and pricing for AWS S3:
Create an S3 Bucket https://s3.console.aws.amazon.com/s3
Uncheck &amp;ldquo;Block all public access&amp;rdquo; since you want all files to be readable.</description></item><item><title>Backblaze B2</title><link>/docs/storage/backblaze/</link><pubDate>Tue, 17 Nov 2020 20:11:42 +0100</pubDate><guid>/docs/storage/backblaze/</guid><description>As of November 2020 Backblaze&amp;rsquo;s B2 is fully S3 compatible.
B2&amp;rsquo;s first 10G of storage is free, and the first 1G of download per day is free after that. Afterwards they charge $0.01/G.
Keys When creating your &amp;ldquo;Application Keys&amp;rdquo; keep in mind that the &amp;ldquo;Application Key ID&amp;rdquo; is the &amp;ldquo;Access Key&amp;rdquo; and the &amp;ldquo;Application Key&amp;rdquo; is the &amp;ldquo;Secret&amp;rdquo;.
It has been suggested that you make sure you set your key setting of &amp;ldquo;Allow access to Bucket&amp;rdquo; to All.</description></item><item><title>Digital Ocean Spaces</title><link>/docs/storage/digitalocean/</link><pubDate>Tue, 17 Nov 2020 20:11:42 +0100</pubDate><guid>/docs/storage/digitalocean/</guid><description>250 GB storage + 1 TB Outbound Transfer for $5/mo.
Digital Ocean Spaces is a good choice if you&amp;rsquo;re already using DigitalOcean to host your server. It should be fast to transfer your video from your server to their storage service, and their pricing will probably just be the flat $5/mo for you, so it&amp;rsquo;s easy to know what you&amp;rsquo;re paying.
Create a new bucket in the DigitalOcean console. Edit your storage config and change the S3 endpoint.</description></item><item><title>Wasabi</title><link>/docs/storage/wasabi/</link><pubDate>Tue, 17 Nov 2020 20:11:42 +0100</pubDate><guid>/docs/storage/wasabi/</guid><description>Please read the following link before using.
&amp;ldquo;However, we do not recommend the playback of video directly from object storage (Wasabi or AWS S3) as the costs may be higher than expected and the delivery quality will be sub-optimal (as compared to solutions that pair object storage with a CDN and/or encoding/decoding functions).&amp;rdquo; -Wasabi Most people would end up paying $5.99/mo with Wasabi, and there&amp;rsquo;s no additional costs for the amount of people or amount of times people access your video.</description></item><item><title>Vultr Object Storage</title><link>/docs/storage/vultr/</link><pubDate>Fri, 28 Jan 2022 01:11:42 +0100</pubDate><guid>/docs/storage/vultr/</guid><description>If you require S3 object storage services and already use Vultr as your hosting provider it might make sense to use their object storage offering as well, since the connection between your Owncast server and your storage provider will be fast.
CORS You will need to follow Vultr&amp;rsquo;s instructions to enable CORS, so your Owncast player will have access to the video.
Setup s3cmd Follow Vultr&amp;rsquo;s documentation on setting up s3cmd so you can configure your object storage bucket.</description></item><item><title>Linode Object Storage</title><link>/docs/storage/linode/</link><pubDate>Tue, 17 Nov 2020 20:11:42 +0100</pubDate><guid>/docs/storage/linode/</guid><description>250 GB storage + 1 TB Outbound Transfer for $5/mo.
