However, some prefer to authenticate themselves to verify their identity to others, and to continue using the same chat identity across multiple devices and browsers. This is especially helpful for those with moderator privileges.
You can access the authentication options via the chat dropdown menu in the upper right of the page.

It shows online/offline states, viewer counts, stream duration, your instance&amp;rsquo;s description, images, links and more. You can just start using it without making any changes, but you&amp;rsquo;ll likely want to update the content displayed on your page by visiting your server admin page.
Additionally, the web interface was specifically built to be editable by anybody comfortable tweaking a web page.</description></item></channel></rss>
